How to make a physical board
==================

[NOTE: The previous engraver seems to have fallen off. The last time I got boards made from him, he totally screwed up the order, and even when he re-did it for free, one of the boards was still quite noticeably wrong. Next time you want to make boards, you should shop around for another laser engraver.]

1. Contact the engraver to ask if they're up for the job.
    - Reference previous orders from them, if any.
    - Describe the boards I'm ordering this time.
    - Attach PNG images of front and back.
        - Maybe SVG is better since that's what they ultimately need, but SVGs have fucky text?
        - Include readable graphic of text dimensions where the measured lines go all the way to the edge of the text.
    - Propose a price of $35/board + shipping, which is what I did with my last engraver.
        - Or use whatever I negotiated with the new engraver.
        - If there was a previous order, propose the same price as before.
    - Tell them what my address is, if it's changed since last time.
    - Wait for them to confirm they're in before proceeding.
2. Order the wood from CraftCuts.
    - "Custom craft shape" product: https://www.craftcuts.com/custom-craft-shape.html
    - Material: Baltic Birch Plywood.
    - Longest dimension: (compute actual longest diameter of board in any direction and round up).
    - Shape thickness: 1/2 inch.
    - Art upload: use PNG format, and upload a schematic with labeled dimensions.
        - Consider digging out old proofs they've previously sent me, if they're for the exact same board design.
    - No comment.
    - Have it shipped to the engraver's work address.
        - Make sure it's the most recent address for them; don't just use the address you used last time.
3. Submit final designs to the engraver.
    - For each board design, run the `./generate` script to generate SVG and PNG images of the front/back/blank versions of it.
    - Open the back (text side) PNG in Krita and add a rectangle around the text.
        - Center the rectangle at the center of the design.
            - This should result in the text being centered in the rectangle. If that's not what you want, figure something out.
        - Label the width and height of the rectangle.
        - Save this image as a seventh image in the folder.
    - Zip all seven images into a zip file.
    - Repeat for each board design.
    - Email these to the engraver.
        - Explain about the rectangles being centered on the board and the text being centered in the rectangles.
        - Mention that the text should be sized proportionally according to the rectangle.
        - Mention that the rectangles are not part of the design.
