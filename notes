How to make a physical board
==================

1. Contact Adam Zalaznik to ask if he's up for the job.
    - Reference previous orders from him.
    - Describe the boards I'm ordering this time.
    - Attach PNG images of front and back.
        - Maybe SVG is better since that's what he ultimately needs, but SVGs have fucky text?
    - Propose a price of $35/board + shipping, which is what we've been doing each time.
    - Wait for him to confirm he's in before proceeding.
2. Order the wood from CraftCuts.
    - "Custom craft shape" product: https://www.craftcuts.com/custom-craft-shape.html
    - Material: Baltic Birch Plywood.
    - Longest dimension: (compute actual longest diameter of board in any direction and round up).
    - Shape thickness: 1/2 inch.
    - Art upload: use PNG format with 1/2" inch image margin on all sides of board (this makes some of the math in the next part easier).
    - Comment format:
        - NOTE: they found this really confusing in my third order on 2024 Nov 8. Maybe try re-wording it. They didn't understand why I was talking about rectangles. Maybe just send them an image that looks like the proofs they send back to me.
        - The attached image is a rectangle measuring [...] pixels wide by [...] pixels tall. The brown part is bare wood and the white part is empty air. The resolution is 300dpi, so the blueprint itself measures [...]" by [...]". The board fits snugly into a [...]"x[...]" rectangle ([...logic and geometry...], so the longest dimension of the board is [...]").
    - Have it shipped to Adam's work address.
        - Remember he's changed addresses at least once, so use the most recent one he's given.
    


==================
Brainstorm: things that look like hexagons or triangles
==================

ramps
slides
garden fences
things that have been knocked over
    dominos
    cards
    house of cards
objects sloped for dunctionality
wheelchair ramp
roof
motion lines of things that travel diagonlally
    swing of a sword
    hand gesture
    cat claw
these ^ are all about diagonal lines
now about triangles:
pine tree
mountain
valley
bermuda triangle
triforce
now hexagons:
honeycomb

- hex
    the essense of Go
    reflected like a moonbeam
    in every board shape
- donut
    the essense of Go
    reflected like a moonbeam
    in every board shape
- 7×7
    stones of slate and shell
    seven lines by seven lines
    teach me how to play
- 5×5
    the essense of Go
    reflected like a moonbeam
    in every board shape
