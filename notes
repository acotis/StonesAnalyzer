How to make a physical board
==================

[NOTE: Adam Zalaznik seems to have fallen off. The last time I got boards made from him, he totally screwed up the order, and even when he re-did it for free, one of the boards was still quite noticeably wrong. Next time you want to make boards, you should shop around for another laser engraver.]

1. Contact Adam Zalaznik to ask if he's up for the job.
    - Reference previous orders from him.
    - Describe the boards I'm ordering this time.
    - Attach PNG images of front and back.
        - Maybe SVG is better since that's what he ultimately needs, but SVGs have fucky text?
        - Include readable graphic of text dimensions where the measured lines go all the way to the edge of the text.
    - Propose a price of $35/board + shipping, which is what we've been doing each time.
    - Tell him what my address is, if it's changed since last time.
    - Wait for him to confirm he's in before proceeding.
2. Order the wood from CraftCuts.
    - "Custom craft shape" product: https://www.craftcuts.com/custom-craft-shape.html
    - Material: Baltic Birch Plywood.
    - Longest dimension: (compute actual longest diameter of board in any direction and round up).
    - Shape thickness: 1/2 inch.
    - Art upload: use PNG format, and upload a schematic with labeled dimensions.
        - Consider digging out old proofs they've previously sent me, if they're for the exact same board design.
    - No comment.
    - Have it shipped to Adam's work address.
        - Remember he's changed addresses at least once, so use the most recent one he's given.
3. Submit final designs to Adam Zalaznik.
    - For each board design, run the `./generate` script to generate SVG and PNG images of the front/back/blank versions of it.
    - Open the back (text side) PNG in Krita and add a rectangle around the text.
        - Center the rectangle at the center of the design.
            - This should result in the text being centered in the rectangle. If that's not what you want, figure something out.
        - Label the width and height of the rectangle.
        - Save this image as a seventh image in the folder.
    - Zip all seven images into a zip file.
    - Repeat for each board design.
    - Email these to Adam Zalaznik.
        - Explain about the rectangles being centered on the board and the text being centered in the rectangles.
        - Mention that the text should be sized proportionally according to the rectangle.
        - Mention that the rectangles are not part of the design.

==================
Brainstorm: things that look like hexagons or triangles
==================

ramps
slides
garden fences
things that have been knocked over
    dominos
    cards
    house of cards
objects sloped for dunctionality
wheelchair ramp
roof
motion lines of things that travel diagonlally
    swing of a sword
    hand gesture
    cat claw
these ^ are all about diagonal lines
now about triangles:
pine tree
mountain
valley
bermuda triangle
triforce
now hexagons:
honeycomb

    reflected like a moonbeam
    in every board shape
- donut

    reflected like a moonbeam
    in every board shape
- 7×7
    stones of slate and shell
    seven lines by seven lines
    teach me how to play
- 5×5
    the essense of Go
    reflected like a moonbeam
    in every board shape
